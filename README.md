Text Invaders
=============

Destroy some bullshit text, let the anger flow!

This is a basic NodeJS Express-based app, with Redis for the highscores.
To run it locally you'll need:

* NodeJs and NPM
* Redis
* That's it. Grunt would be useful as well!

Clone it, run `npm install` for the dependencies and then either launch server.js directly with node or use the grunt task `grunt server` - besides launching the server, it watches/compiles less to css and restarts the server when you change js files.
